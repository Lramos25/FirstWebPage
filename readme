My wife opened her own hair salon. I jumped at the chance to create my first ever website. 

I needed to looked up just about ever aspect of the process but this turned out pretty good for my first webpage.

This also allowed me to gain some very valuable experience in communicating with non technical clients. 

The entire project was treated as though she had hired me - at least on my end.

Some of her requirements where:

"The webpage needed to be responsive" - display nicely on all devices
"Multiple pages for each section" - multipage design
"Links to social media and booking application" - links to outside sources
"Map to shop location so customers can easily find the shop" - the map that some websites have with their location marked on it

Other parts I made sure to utilize her input for are the color scheme, overall layout, and of course content inclusion. I am not a designer, nor am I any good at anything artistic.
I made the basic page, designed as I thought was functional with a color pallate that I selcted based on about 4 hours of reading color theory. I relied on the client for the 
final look and flow of the webpage. 

I used hostgator for the domain and hosting. There is one aspect I am not satisfied with and currently attempting to figure out. Part of the package we used allows for the "https" 
to be used. I have not worked out how to get the webpage to function with the https yet. I have aplied for a certificate but it gets denied. The links to the outside websites are
all secure and the images used are internal files. I will update this once that gets resolved.

If you want to go to the page itself here is the link:

Below are some screenshots for a quick look at the live webpage and some thoughts on each.

- For each, the links to other pages use a "highlight" fuction when the visitor hovers over it. 
- All external links (booking and social media) open in new tabs. 
- The idea is to preserve the visitor on the clients website.

Index (home) page. Designed the background image out of four different pictures. Used it as backdrop to emphisise "hair" and put the business model front and center.
The layout for the index page is meant to be simple and get the visitor to select another page to visit.

The services page includes a small description for each offered service and a disclaimer designed to help inform clients of any variables that can impact the final price. 
I wanted to make the disclaimer follow the page as the visitor scrolls down. This was not utilized but is on my list of things to do later.

The contact page uses a standard method to include the location of the shop from google maps. Not difficult, but I was happy that I was able to figure out how to include this part.
