My wife opened her own hair salon. I jumped at the chance to create my first ever website. 

I needed to looked up just about ever aspect of the process but this turned out pretty good for my first webpage.

This also allowed me to gain some very valuable experience in communicating with non technical clients. 

The entire project was treated as though she had hired me - at least on my end.

Some of her requirements where:

"The webpage needed to be responsive" - display nicely on all devices
"Multiple pages for each section" - multipage design
"Links to social media and booking application" - links to outside sources
"Map to shop location so customers can easily find the shop" - the map that some websites have with their location marked on it

Other parts I made sure to utilize her input for are the color scheme, overall layout, and of course content inclusion. I am not a designer, nor am I any good at anything artistic.
I made the basic page, designed as I thought was functional with a color pallate that I selcted based on about 4 hours of reading color theory. I relied on the client for the 
final look and flow of the webpage. 

I used hostgator for the domain and hosting. There is one aspect I am not satisfied with and currently attempting to figure out. Part of the package we used allows for the "https" 
to be used. I have not worked out how to get the webpage to function with the https yet. I have aplied for a certificate but it gets denied. The links to the outside websites are
all secure and the images used are internal files. I will update this once that gets resolved.

If you want to go to the page itself here is the link:

Below are some screenshots for a quick look at the live webpage.
